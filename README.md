# pi-token-burden

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pi-token-burden)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-token-burden)
[![CI](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Whamp/pi-token-burden/check.yml)](https://github.com/Whamp/pi-token-burden/actions)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

See where your system prompt tokens go.

A [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi) extension that parses the assembled
system prompt and shows a token-budget breakdown by section. Run `/token-burden`
to see how much of your context window is consumed by the base prompt, context
files (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md), skills, SYSTEM.md overrides, and metadata.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-token-burden
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/Whamp/pi-token-burden
```

To try it for a single session without installing, use `pi -e npm:pi-token-burden`.

### Requirements

- [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi) v0.55.1 or later

### Pi Atelier sidebar

If [Pi Atelier](https://github.com/michaelmjhhhh/pi-atelier) is installed, Token Burden can publish a compact, read-only budget summary to its sidebar. Enable and position the `Token burden` panel from Atelier's display settings.

The `/token-burden` command remains the full interactive view. Pi Atelier is optional and is not a dependency of this package.

## Usage

Type `/token-burden` in any pi session. An overlay appears with a stacked bar
and a drill-down table:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Whamp/pi-token-burden/main/screenshot.png" alt="pi-token-burden main view" width="720" />
</p>

The table is sorted by token count (descending). Use arrow keys to navigate,
Enter to drill down into children (e.g., individual skills or context files),
and `/` to fuzzy-search items.

**Drill-down views:**

### Base prompt source tracing

Press `t` when the cursor is on the **Base prompt** row to run an on-demand
attribution trace. This analyzes extension tool registrations and matches their
prompt snippets and guidelines against the lines in the Base prompt, showing:

- **Built-in/core** — tools and guidelines hardcoded in pi
- **Extension buckets** — lines contributed by specific extensions
- **Shared** — lines registered by multiple extensions
- **Unattributed** — lines that couldn't be matched to any source

Press `Enter` on any bucket to see line-level evidence with per-line token counts.

### Tool definitions

Tool definitions are the function schemas sent to the LLM alongside the system prompt. They are not part of the system prompt text, but they still consume context window tokens through the tool-calling API. Counts use the active model API's tool envelope when Pi exposes it, excluding Pi-internal metadata and pretty-printing used only for display.

`/token-burden` compares Pi's full registered tool catalog with the current active tool set:

- The top-level Tool definitions row counts only active tool schemas and shows active/total inventory, for example `Tool definitions (4 active, 11 total)`.
- Selecting Tool definitions opens a dedicated read-only Tools view.
- `Active` is expanded by default. Active rows show plain token costs such as `182 tok`, sorted by token cost descending.
- `Inactive` is collapsed by default. Inactive tools remain visible as counterfactual costs such as `+182 tok if enabled`, but they do not affect the stacked bar, section totals, or percentages.
- Press `e` on any tool row to see its full JSON definition in your editor.

Tool-related guideline text remains accounted under **Base prompt**. The **Tool definitions** section is limited to schema payload.

### What each section measures

| Section                          | Content                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base prompt**                  | pi's built-in instructions, tool descriptions, guidelines                                |
| **SYSTEM.md / APPEND_SYSTEM.md** | Your custom system prompt overrides                                                      |
| **Context files**                | Each AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md file, listed individually                                     |
| **Skills**                       | The `<available_skills>` block, with per-skill breakdown                                 |
| **Tool definitions**             | Active LLM function schemas; inactive schemas shown as counterfactual `if enabled` costs |
| **Metadata**                     | The `Current date and time` / `Current working directory` footer                         |

### Token estimation

Tokens are counted using [gpt-tokenizer](https://github.com/niieani/gpt-tokenizer)
with the `o200k_base` encoding (used by GPT-4o, o1, o3, and other modern models).
Treat counts as `o200k_base` estimates when using Claude, Gemini, Mistral, or other
models with different tokenizers. They are still exact BPE counts for this encoding,
not character-based approximations.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Whamp/pi-token-burden.git
cd pi-token-burden
pnpm install
pnpm run test     # 166 unit tests
pnpm run test:e2e # 34 e2e tests (requires tmux)
pnpm run check    # lint, typecheck, format, dead code, duplicates, tests
```

Test locally: `pi -e ./src/index.ts`, then type `/token-burden`.
