# Key Decisions

## Token counting

Use BPE tokenization with `gpt-tokenizer` and `o200k_base` instead of a character-count heuristic. This keeps reported budget numbers close to the model-facing token cost.

## Overlay design

Use one `BudgetOverlay` TUI with drill-downs rather than separate commands for every feature. This keeps the top-level command simple while exposing deeper views for AGENTS files, skills, trace buckets, and tool definitions.

## Skill management

Skill management is integrated into the Skills drill-down. Skills use a three-state model:

- Enabled — included normally.
- Hidden — removed from model invocation / system prompt burden.
- Disabled — unavailable.

The overlay updates token impact immediately and persists changes only when the user saves.

## Skill discovery

Use filesystem discovery that matches pi's scan order: project-local, ancestor, then user-global. Duplicate skills with the same name are handled coherently so toggling affects all relevant copies.

## Editor handoff

Use the `tui.stop()` / `tui.start()` pattern when launching external editors. File-backed items (`SKILL.md`, `AGENTS.md`) open directly; generated prompt sections and tool JSON open as temporary content files.

Temp files are not explicitly deleted after editor launch because asynchronous editors such as VS Code can fork and return before reading the file.

## Source Trace

Attach Source Trace to Tool Prompt Text, not to Combined System Prompt or Pi Core Prompt. Trace the exact `Available tools` and `Guidelines` spans. Use deterministic one-pass introspection for the fast path: normalize and match evidence, preserve shared evidence as `Shared (multiple sources)`, and label unmatched text `Unattributed`. Optional subprocess analysis remains a separate, user-triggered deep mode.

## Tool definitions count

Include tool/function schemas from `pi.getAllTools()` in the budget. These schemas are sent through the LLM tool-calling API and can be a substantial hidden context cost even when absent from literal system-prompt text.

## Lazy command loading

Keep the extension entrypoint startup-safe: `src/index.ts` only registers `/token-burden` and the Atelier sidebar listener. Heavy modules (tokenizer via `measureTokenBudget.ts` → `parser.ts`, report UI, skill scanning, base trace) are dynamically imported on first real use — the first `/token-burden` invocation or an actual Atelier measurement trigger (discover / agent event).

Why: loading `gpt-tokenizer` and the report stack at extension load added roughly 400 ms to every pi startup (upstream issue #33) even for users who never run the command. ES module caching means the first invocation pays the load cost and later invocations in the same process are free.

Boundary rule (must survive future feature integration): startup-safe code is command registration plus tiny event bootstrap only. If a live UI (e.g. the Atelier sidebar) needs token calculation, perform the heavy import only after the UI has actually requested or activated the panel — never at pi startup.

The command module is named `runTokenBurden.ts` (not `token-burden-command.ts`) to satisfy the `@factory/filename-match-export` lint rule without a per-file override.

## Combined token burden taxonomy

Use **Combined System Prompt** and **Combined Tool Definitions** as the top-level budget surfaces. "Combined" means the effective runtime surface is assembled from pi core plus user/project/extension contributions.

- Combined System Prompt child rows: Pi Core Prompt, User System Prompt, Extension Prompt Additions, Tool Prompt Text, Project Instructions, Skill Catalog, Session Metadata, Prompt Boundary Overhead.
- Combined Tool Definitions child rows: Pi Core Tools, Extension Tools, SDK / Custom Tools, Inactive Available Tools, Tool Envelope Overhead.

Extension Prompt Additions is a non-counted row labeled **Not separately measurable**; its unknown contribution remains inside the Pi Core Prompt upper bound. Prompt Boundary Overhead is the counted reconciliation row for BPE boundary effects and separators between measured literal spans.

Inactive Available Tools is a collapsed, non-counted counterfactual grouped by the same Pi Core, Extension, and SDK / Custom source taxonomy as active tools. Its source groups and per-tool leaves reconcile schema-only as `+N tok schema`; Tool Envelope Overhead is never allocated to the inactive branch.

Do not keep **Base prompt** or **Preamble** as user-facing taxonomy. Those are implementation-shaped concepts; the user-facing model should show where the burden is carried and who/what contributed it.

## Documentation system

Agent-facing project documentation now uses napkin instead of Brain `.memory/` files. The root `NAPKIN.md` is the level-0 overview, with topic notes under `architecture/`, `decisions/`, `guides/`, and `changelog/`.
